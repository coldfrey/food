# The Food App

Ok so in todays world it is widely accepted that there are 2 factors that will have the biggest impact on you health and longevity than anything else.

1. Exercise
2. Diet

This project is about the second one, diet.

In a world of ultra processed foods, fast food and convenience foods it is easy to make the wrong choices when it comes to what you eat. Most people in developed western western eat a diet that is majority processed 'foods', as far as i'm concerned these are not food, they are artificial substances that are designed to be addictive and make you want to eat more of them.

For the last 100,000 years humans have been eating a diet that is made up of whole foods, things that are grown or raised. We have adapted and evolved with these foods, and have been a member of the food chain for a long time. Recently we have diverged from this path and it is having a huge impact on our health.

When was the last time you saw a fat wild animal? They don't exist, likewise when was the last time you saw a fat person who ate a diet of 100% whole foods? They don't exist either. Obesity is a modern problem, and it is caused by the food we eat. Historically to be fat was a sign of wealth, only the richest folk such as kings and queens with teams of cooks could manage to gain the weight, now it is a sign of poor health.

"Food" (the app - name to be decided), will have a number of features that take the uncertainty out of eating well, and make it easy to make the right choices.

1. 'What to cook' - A feature that will suggest recipes based on what you have in your fridge. Take a picture of a selection of ingredients and the app will suggest a recipe that you can make with them.
2. 'What to buy' - A feature to use in the super market, pull out your camera and show the phone the item. The app will tell you in realtime if this is an ultra processed food that should be avoided, without you having to read any labels.
3. 'Planning Phase' - Your someone who's busy and only wants to cook twice a week maximum, the app will help you plan your meals for the week. Be presented with a list of recipes, choose one, the app will work out the portions and generated a shopping list for you. In the future this will be connected to your local supermarket and you can have the items delivered to your door. Minimum clicks to have the ingredients you need in your hand - no effort.
4. 'What did I eat' - A feature where you take a picture of the ingredients pre cooking (if you cooked) and the meal right before you eat it. The app will then track these meals over time and give you a clean eating score.

This is a project that aims to take all the hard decisions out of eating well
